          Money is not the only commodity that is fun to give. We can give time,
          we can give our expertise, we can give our love, or simply give a
          smile.

          Love grows by giving. The love we give away is the only love we keep.
          The only way to retain love is to give it away.

          <h3>Food for a family</h3>
          <p>
            Food for us comes from our relatives, whether they have wings or
            fins or roots. That is how we consider food. Food has a culture. It
            has a history. It has a story. It has relationships.

          <h3>Shelter for a family</h3>
          <p>
            Don't let the rain drive you to the wrong shelter; the shade can
            turn out to be your protector and also your destroyer, and sometimes
            the rain is the perfect protector from the rain.

          <h3>Education for a child</h3>
          <p>
            For a small child there is no division between playing and learning;
            between the things he or she does ‘just for fun’ and things that are
            ‘educational.’ The child learns while living and any part of living
            that is enjoyable is also play.
